    title: "Javascript: The Good Parts",
    author: "Douglas Crockford",
    releaseYear: 2008,
    genre: "Programming",
    synopsis:
      "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a wholeâ€”a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.",
